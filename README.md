Welcome to the repository for my personal website, now powered by Quartz v4. This site serves as a reflection of my professional journey, offering insights and forging connections with like-minded individuals and teams.

Personal Website + Digital Garden - Crafted with [Quartz v4](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/), providing an enhanced, user-friendly experience.

The work for this site is completed in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), with additional development in [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

About Me

I'm Jeff Camacho, an Agile software development advocate with a diverse background in the Army and academia. My journey has led me from repairing specialized electronics, leading soldiers as a squad leader, to excelling in Electrical Engineering and an MBA program. Currently, I'm at the helm of projects at BigBear.ai, delivering software solutions with precision and agility.

Outside the realm of technology, I've explored entrepreneurship, applying the same dedication to wielding a broom as managing code. My ventures and experiences have sharpened my skills in team leadership, project management, and operational efficiency.

Committed to lifelong learning, I dedicate my time to coaching veterans and service members, sharing insights from every step of my journey.
