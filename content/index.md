title: Hello and Welcome.
---

My name is Jeff. I'm an Army veteran and live in San Antonio, Tx with my wife and soon-to-be-born child (not telling yet!). I work as an Agile Coach in the defense technology sphere and I really try to be a creative person. I love to write and provide structure to things, while also expressing a little controlled chaos to my words to instigate divergent paths of thought. I *lightly* dabble in photography, but it's something I want to get into more.

Here you will find my [[Digital Garden]]. I write here mostly for myself to provide a structured, world-facing space to lay my words down on digital paper. You'll find much more studying and structure here, but I try to branch out. You'll also find my linked ideas. They're for anyone. Open them up and take them in. Leave what you don't like, but take what you want to.

This is my *second* site migration and you'll find the backstory of all of that here: [[8-11-23 New Site New Outlook]].

What you'll usually find here:

- I tend to write mostly about #Agile and #project-management
- #music I find interesting
- #books that I've read (or not read)
- Rantings on why my Fantasy Baseball Team isn't doing so hot

Either way, feel free to read through my ramblings, studies, and attempts at writing.
