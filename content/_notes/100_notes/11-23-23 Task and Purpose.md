# My views on task and purpose

During my career transition to project management, I've worn several hats as a Technical Program Manager and a spectrum of Agile roles, specifically in SAFe. During this time, I've come to realize that directed work has a much different impact than a shared vision. Task and Purpose (so late on picking up this site title!), have come to manifest in so many different ways to me.

With that being said, understanding the concepts of task and purpose from the perspectives of a SAFe Agilist and a Program Manager requires a straightforward approach, focusing on how these roles apply these concepts in their respective domains of Agile frameworks and program management.

Spoiler alert:

> [[Manage processes; lead people]].

## SAFe Agilist Perspective

A SAFe Agilist, working within the Scaled Agile Framework, views tasks as specific activities that contribute to larger goals like sprint objectives or Program [[Increment]]s (PIs). These tasks are seen as small but essential parts of a collaborative effort aimed at achieving the broader objectives of the Agile Release Train (ART) or the organizationâ€™s goals.

### Key Techniques:

- [[PI Planning]]: Here, tasks are specific actions or stories committed to in a Program Increment, while the purpose is reflected in the PI Objectives, outlining what each team aims to achieve.
- [[Iteration Goals]]: The goals for each sprint or iteration are achieved through completing tasks, which align with the overall Lean-Agile values.
- [[Value Stream Mapping]]: This technique helps to see tasks as steps in the value delivery process, with the purpose being the delivery of value to the customer.

## Program Manager's Perspective

A Program Manager, especially in traditional project management, views tasks as individual work units necessary to meet certain milestones or project objectives. The purpose, in this context, is seen as the broader goal or strategic objective of the program or project.

### Key Techniques:

- [[Work Breakdown Structure]] (WBS): In WBS, tasks are derived from project deliverables, linked to the project and program objectives.
- [[Gantt Chart]]s: These charts help schedule and track tasks, with the purpose indicated by the achievement of major milestones.
- [[Risk Management]]: Here, risks are managed at the task level, with an understanding of their impact on the overall purpose.

## Philosophical Aspect: Task vs. Purpose

Looking at this from a more philosophical angle:

- [[Task]] as a Component of Action: Each task is a small yet important part of the larger project, representing a step towards an intended outcome.
- [[Purpose]] as the Overall Direction: Purpose is the reason behind the tasks, reflecting the broader impact on stakeholders and the organization.

## Combining These Views

- **Practical Execution:** When tasks are carried out with an awareness of their larger role, they become more than routine work. This approach encourages viewing each task as contributing to a larger goal.
- **[[Leadership]]:** Leaders need to help their teams understand how their tasks tie into the broader objectives, emphasizing the importance and impact of their work.
- **Reflective Practices:** Techniques like retrospectives in Agile or lessons learned in traditional management are crucial for linking daily tasks to the larger objectives.

## Task and purpose 

As seen from the perspectives of a SAFe Agilist and a Program Manager, are crucial concepts in professional environments. They represent the practical application of daily activities (tasks) in alignment with overarching goals (purpose). This understanding is essential for ensuring that every task contributes effectively to the strategic objectives of a project or organization.

All the best.
