Evergreen notes are Andy Matuschak's take on [[Zettelkasten]]. This is more modern, digital-first way of note taking that focuses on 'accumulating knowledge over time' than building connections, or creating outputs.

Both [[Zettelkasten]] and Evergreen Notes suggests the concept of making notes that are concept-based, atomic and densely linked notes. [[Difference between Evergreen and Zettel]]
