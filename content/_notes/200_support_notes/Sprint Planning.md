Scrum Event that is time-boxed to 8 hours, or less, to start a Sprint. It serves for the Scrum Team to inspect the work from the Product Backlog thatâ€™s most valuable to be done next and design that work into Sprint backlog.

- **Purpose**: To set the scope and goals for the upcoming sprint.
- **Participants**: The Product Owner, Scrum Master, and the Development Team.
- **Process**: The Product Owner presents the top items on the product backlog for consideration. The team then discusses these items, estimates the effort required, and decides which items they can commit to completing during the sprint.
- **Outcome**: A sprint goal is defined, and a sprint backlog (the set of items to be worked on during the sprint) is created.
