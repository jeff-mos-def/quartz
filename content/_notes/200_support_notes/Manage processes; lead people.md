Managing people doesn't mean that you need to control people's work. That will end up in micro-managing. The job isÂ _not to manage people_, but toÂ _manage processes_Â andÂ _lead people_.

Manage process by setting expectation. Lead by example and through empathy. 

The statement can be broken down into separate components:

<u>Managing Processes:</u>
   
- **Setting Expectations**: Effective process management involves establishing clear expectations regarding work procedures, project timelines, quality standards, and desired outcomes. This provides a structured framework within which team members can operate.
- **Creating Efficient Systems**: It involves designing and implementing efficient systems and processes that enable the smooth execution of tasks. This might include workflow optimizations, resource allocations, and establishing best practices.
- **Monitoring and Adjusting**: Regular monitoring of processes to ensure they are effective and making necessary adjustments based on feedback and performance data is crucial. This includes being agile enough to adapt processes as business needs or environments change.

<u>Leading People:</u>
   
- **Leading by Example**: Leaders should model the behavior, ethics, and attitudes they expect from their team members. Leading by example helps to build trust and sets a positive tone for the work environment.
- **Empathy and Understanding**: Effective leadership requires empathy, understanding the diverse needs, motivations, and challenges of individual team members. This involves active listening, providing support, and fostering an inclusive and respectful work culture.
- **Empowerment and Development**: Instead of micromanaging, leaders should empower their team members, giving them autonomy and the opportunity to take ownership of their work. This also involves investing in their professional growth and development.
- **Inspiration and Motivation**: Good leaders inspire and motivate their teams towards achieving goals. This can be through recognizing achievements, providing constructive feedback, and aligning team objectives with a meaningful purpose.
