Extreme Programming (XP) is an [[Agile]] [[Software Development]] methodology that emphasizes customer satisfaction, rapid feedback, continuous improvement, and high-quality software. It was introduced by Kent Beck in the late 1990s as a response to the limitations of traditional software development processes. XP is known for its unique approach to software engineering, focusing on technical practices and collaboration. 

Key elements of Extreme Programming include:

1. **Frequent Releases**: XP advocates for small, frequent releases of the software to get rapid feedback from users and adapt the product accordingly.
    
2. **Customer Involvement**: The methodology emphasizes close collaboration with the customer, who is involved throughout the development process and helps to define and prioritize requirements.
    
3. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: XP uses TDD, where tests are written before the code. This ensures that each feature is properly tested and meets requirements before moving forward.
    
4. **Pair Programming**: Developers work in pairs, sharing a single workstation. One writes code while the other reviews each line as it's written. This promotes knowledge sharing and reduces the likelihood of bugs.
    
5. **Simple Design and Continuous Refactoring**: XP promotes designing simply but effectively. Continuous refactoring is encouraged to improve the design and maintainability of the code as the project evolves.
    
6. **Sustainable Pace**: XP stresses the importance of maintaining a sustainable workload to avoid burnout and ensure high-quality work.
    
7. **Collective Code Ownership**: Code is owned by the team rather than individuals, allowing any team member to improve any part of the code at any time.
    
8. **Coding Standards**: Developers adhere to a common set of coding standards and practices to ensure consistency and quality across the codebase.
    
9. **Continuous Integration**: XP practices continuous integration, frequently merging code changes into a shared repository to detect issues early.
    
10. **User Stories**: Requirements are expressed as user stories, which are brief descriptions of features from the perspective of the end user.
    

Extreme Programming is particularly effective in projects where requirements are unclear or rapidly changing. Its practices are designed to improve software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
