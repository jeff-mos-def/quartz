All your tasks are not created equal. All tasks doesn't deserve your best effort. 

Divide task to three types - Leverage, Neutral and Overhead. Do a great focused job if it's a leverage task. Do a strictly good job for neutral task. And for overhead tasks, just get it done. (10x, 1x and <1x)

In my bullet journal, I use up-arrow/dash/down-arrow instead of LNO as letters causes confusion.
