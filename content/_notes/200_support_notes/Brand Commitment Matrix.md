Brand Commitment Matrix is describes as a “basic contract” brand owners can create between their company or brand and its customers. The matrix has two columns, each containing three key statements.

The left hand statements (IAM or I am) are from brand’s customers and has 
- Identity (Who they are)
- Aims (What they want)
- Mores (How they belong)

Right side column (POV) is for the company or brand and has 
- Purpose (Why we exist), 
- Onlyness (What we offer) 
- Values (How we behave). 

The idea recommended here is to ensure that each row aligns with another/support each other. That means, Identity should sync with purpose, aims with onlyness and Mores with values.
