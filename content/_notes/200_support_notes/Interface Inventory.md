> An interface inventory is a comprehensive collection of the bits and pieces that make up your interface.
#### How to:
- Take screenshots of all components, dump them to some products like Miro, FigmaJam, or Keynote. 
- Categories them, understand the usage. 
- Name them, and arrange them based on similarity. 
- Simplify, reduce and distill until all use-cases are sorted. 
- Make notes on why and why not.
