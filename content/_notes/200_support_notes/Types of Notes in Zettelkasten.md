Zettelkasten suggest making three kinds of note. The first one is a **fleeting note**, which is a rough note, made for remembering ideas, terms, jarons or even examples. These are what you make while consuming knowledge (while reading, lecture etc). 

Once you have fleeting notes, the system recommends you to write each idea separately ([[Atomicity]]), in your own words. You can explain and provide context, but try to keep one idea per note. These notes are called **Literature Notes**. 

Once you have multiple Literature Notes, [[Never brainstorm for a topic]] but go through multiple notes, find concepts or insights from multiple lit-notes and build permanent notes. 

> Fleets are reminders, Lits are one note about one topic from one source, while permanent notes connects multiple lit notes and creates knowledge, specific to a concept.
