How a problem is framed makes a big difference in perceptions and solutions. 
#### Example: MPG Illusion
> “Consider two car owners who seek to reduce their costs: A switches from a gas-guzzler of 12 mpg to a slightly less greedy guzzler that runs at 14 mpg.The environmentally virtuous B switches from a 30 mpg car to one that runs at 40 mpg. Suppose both drivers travel equal distances over a year. Who will save more gas by switching?" 
> The is intuition that B’s action is more significant than A’s, but it's wrong. (119 vs. 83). The frame used here, "mpg" is wrong. (It should be gallon-per-mile.) hence, we are getting the wrong perspective.
