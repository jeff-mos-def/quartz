A task refers to a specific piece of work or an activity that needs to be accomplished. It is usually a defined and measurable action or set of actions, often with a clear beginning and end. Tasks can be simple or complex and can vary in duration and scope. In essence, a task is what needs to be done. 

For example, writing a report, conducting a meeting, or completing a homework assignment are all tasks.
