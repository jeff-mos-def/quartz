Project management is the use of specific knowledge, skills, tools and techniques to deliver something of value to people. The development of software for an improved business process, the construction of a building, the relief effort after a natural disaster, the expansion of sales into a new geographic market—these are all examples of projects.

It is the discipline of initiating, planning, executing, controlling, and closing the work of a team to achieve specific goals and meet specific success criteria within a specified time. It involves the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to ensure the project's objectives are met. Key aspects of project management include:

1. **[[Initiation]]**: This phase involves defining the project at a broad level, establishing its overall scope, and securing necessary approvals to proceed.
    
2. **[[Planning]]**: Involves detailed mapping out of the steps necessary to complete the project. This includes setting goals, defining roles and responsibilities, developing schedules, allocating resources, and preparing for potential risks.
    
3. **[[Execution]]**: This is the phase where the plans are put into action. It involves managing teams, resources, and stakeholder communication, ensuring that project activities are executed as planned.
    
4. **[[Monitoring and Controlling]]**: Concurrent with execution, this phase involves tracking the project's progress and performance to ensure it stays on track and aligned with the plan. Adjustments and changes are made as needed.
    
5. **[[Closing]]**: In the final phase, the project is formally closed, deliverables are handed over, and documentation is completed. It also often involves evaluating what went well and what didn’t for future reference.
    

Effective project management is essential for the successful completion of projects. It helps ensure that project goals are met within the constraints of scope, time, quality, and budget, and it is critical in identifying and mitigating potential risks and issues. Project management methodologies and approaches can vary, ranging from traditional methods like the Waterfall model to more flexible and adaptive approaches like [[Agile]].
