The Eisenhower Matrix or Urgent-Important Matrix is a framework that helps in prioritizing tasks by urgency and importance. The matrix is divided into four :  

1. Top being Important (I)
2. bottom for Not-important (NI)
3. left for Urgent (U)
4. right for Not-urgent (NU) 

This gives four quadrants NU+I, U+I, U+NI and NU+NI.
-  **Do** what's in Urgent and Important
-  **Schedule** Important but not Urgent
-  **Delegate** not important but urgent 
-  **ignore** what's not important or urgent.

Ankur Warikoo recommended adding a [[Third dimension to Eisenhower Matrix]], and making it practically easier.
