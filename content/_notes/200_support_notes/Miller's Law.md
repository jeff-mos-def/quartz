Miller's Law, as proposed by psychologist George Miller, suggests that an individual's working memory can hold an average of seven (plus or minus two) distinct items at one time. This concept highlights the limitations of our cognitive capacity to process and retain multiple pieces of information simultaneously. 

For example, in a meeting where numerous project details are discussed, a person might struggle to remember more than seven key points without using strategies like note-taking or grouping related information together (chunking).
