Maslow's hierarchy of needs is a motivational theory in psychology comprising a five-tier model of human needs, often depicted as hierarchical levels within a pyramid. 

- **5.Self-actualization** - The top of the pyramid is more about personal growth, less concerned with the opinions of others. 
- **4. Esteem Needs** - At this point, it becomes increasingly important to gain the respect and appreciation of others. People need to accomplish things and then have their efforts recognized.
- **3.Social Needs** - the need for emotional relationships drives human behavior. E.g., Friendship. 
- **2.Safety Needs** - People want control and order in their lives. So, this need for safety and security contributes largely to behaviors at this level—Fin Security, Health, etc.
- **1.Physiological Needs** - Bottom of the pyramid, The basic physiological needs are vital to our survival. E.g., Food, Shelter.
