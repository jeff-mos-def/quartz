The process of the coming into existence or prominence of new facts or new knowledge of a fact, or knowledge of a fact becoming visible unexpectedly.

It refers to the process through which new facts or knowledge come into existence, gain prominence, or become visible in an unexpected or unforeseen manner. This concept is often associated with complex systems where new properties or behaviors manifest themselves that are not evident from the individual elements of the system. 

Key aspects of emergence:

1. **Novelty and Unpredictability**: Emergence highlights the appearance of new characteristics or knowledge that were not anticipated based on existing conditions or understanding. This novelty aspect makes emergent phenomena often surprising or unexpected.
    
2. **Complex Systems**: Emergence is commonly observed in complex systems where the interaction of individual components leads to new patterns or properties at the macro level. These emergent properties are not inherent in any single part of the system but result from the interactions within the whole system.
    
3. **Nonlinearity**: Emergent phenomena often result from nonlinear interactions, where small changes or inputs in a system can produce disproportionately large or qualitatively different outcomes.
    
4. **Self-Organization**: In many cases, emergence is associated with self-organization, where a system organizes itself into a complex structure without external guidance. This self-organization is a key feature of emergent phenomena in natural and social systems.
    
5. **Cross-Disciplinary Relevance**: Emergence is a concept that spans across multiple disciplines, including physics, biology, sociology, economics, and information technology. In each of these fields, it describes the way complex systems and patterns arise out of relatively simple interactions.
    
6. **Dynamic Process**: Emergence is not a static event but a dynamic process. It involves the ongoing development and evolution of systems, leading to the continuous creation of new properties or insights.
    

Emergence, as a concept, captures the idea of new and unexpected patterns, properties, or knowledge arising from the interactions within a system. It emphasizes the unpredictable and dynamic nature of complex systems, where the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
