Purpose is the reason or the underlying motivation for doing something. It is the 'why' behind an action or a series of actions. The purpose gives meaning and direction to tasks and activities, guiding how they are performed and helping to prioritize them. 

For instance, the purpose of writing a report could be to inform decision-making, the purpose of a meeting could be to facilitate team collaboration, and the purpose of a homework assignment could be to enhance understanding of a subject.
