A digital garden is a personal online space that resembles a garden in the sense that it's cultivated, nurtured, and ever-evolving. It is not structured like a traditional blog or website with static content; rather, it's a collection of thoughts, ideas, resources, and notes that grow and change over time. This concept is often used by individuals who wish to document their learning journey, share insights, and explore topics in a non-linear and organic way.

Digital gardens are characterized by their fluidity and lack of a strict organizational structure, encouraging exploration and discovery. They often include various types of content such as written notes, links, sketches, and other media, reflecting the owner's interests, knowledge, and personal growth. This approach to sharing information online emphasizes personal development and continuous learning, rather than presenting polished, finalized content.
