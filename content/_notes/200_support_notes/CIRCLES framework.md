Circles is a Problem solving framework with 7 steps. Comprehend, Identify, Report Needs, Cut through Prioritization, List Solution, Evaluate and Summarize. 

- **1. Comprehend** - Team often lacks context. Provide them by focusing on four things
- **2. Identify** Identify the ideal customer persona (one or more). [[--You can’t build a product that works for everyone]]
- **3. Report customer needs** Customers have needs and problems. Using surveys and interactions, the product team 'can' discover user needs and document them.
- **4. Cut through & Prioritize needs** Plot results from step 3 to 4-Column matrix called Value Matrix
	- X-Axis - Low Value to High Value
	- Y-Axis - High Willingness to Pay, to Low Willingness
		- Top-Right is the Difference. 
		- Bottom-Right will be core features
		- Top-lefts are add-ons
		- Bottom-left contains trashes
		- Very similar to [[Eisenhower Matrix]]
- **5. List solutions** Pick the job-to-be-done you are trying to work on and ask the team to list a range of possible solutions.
- **6. Evaluate trade-offs**
	- Evaluate trade-offs by looking at impact/complexity matrix
	- Make a decision
