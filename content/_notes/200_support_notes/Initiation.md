Initiation is the first phase in the [[Project Management]] process, where a [[Project]] is formally started, defined, and scoped. This phase involves several key steps to ensure the project begins on a solid foundation. 

Key aspects of the Initiation phase include:

1. **Identifying the Project**: The need for the project is identified, often in response to a business problem, opportunity, or requirement.
    
2. **Defining the Project Scope**: This involves outlining the project's objectives, goals, and deliverables, ensuring there is a clear understanding of what the project is meant to achieve.
    
3. **Stakeholder Identification**: Identifying all the parties who have an interest in the project, including those who will be affected by it or can influence its outcome.
    
4. **Feasibility Study**: Assessing the project's viability, considering factors like technical feasibility, financial constraints, and resource availability.
    
5. **Developing the Project Charter**: This document formally authorizes the project, outlining its purpose, objectives, scope, and key stakeholders. It serves as a reference point throughout the project.
    
6. **Forming the Project Team**: Assembling the team that will work on the project, including assigning a project manager to lead the effort.
    
7. **Establishing Initial Resources and Budget**: Estimating and securing the initial resources, budget, and other requirements necessary for the project to proceed.
    
8. **Setting Preliminary Timelines**: Outlining a high-level timeline for the project, including major milestones and estimated durations.
    

The Initiation phase is critical in laying the groundwork for a project, ensuring that it is started with a clear purpose and plan, and with the necessary support and resources. This phase sets the stage for the planning phase that follows.
