A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service, or result. It has a defined beginning and end, typically constrained by time, resources, or deliverables, and is conducted to meet specific goals and objectives, often to bring about beneficial change or added value. 

Key characteristics of a project include:

1. **Temporary and Unique**: Projects are temporary, meaning they have a specific start and end date. They are not ongoing efforts. The output or result of a project is unique, differing in some distinguishing way from similar products or services.
    
2. **Defined Scope and Objectives**: Each project has a defined scope, outlining what needs to be accomplished. The objectives are specific goals that the project aims to achieve, typically in terms of cost, schedule, and performance requirements.
    
3. **Resource Allocation**: Projects involve the allocation of resources, which can include people, equipment, technology, and money. These resources are utilized to perform the project tasks and achieve objectives.
    
4. **Progressive Elaboration**: Projects often evolve and develop as more detailed information and more accurate estimates become available. This process is known as progressive elaboration.
    
5. **Risk and Uncertainty**: Projects inherently involve a level of risk and uncertainty since they are often breaking new ground or creating something that has not been done before.
    
6. **Stakeholder Involvement**: Projects typically have stakeholders, which are individuals or groups that have an interest in the outcome of the project. Effective stakeholder management is crucial for project success.
    

Projects can vary greatly in complexity and size and can be found in a variety of fields, from construction and engineering to IT, healthcare, and event planning. The successful management of a project requires careful [[Initiation]], [[Planning]], [[Execution]], [[Monitoring and Controlling]], and [[Closing]].
