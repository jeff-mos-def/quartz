Design tokens are the “subatomic” foundation of a design system. They are the values needed to build a design system, like color, space, typography, etc., **represented as data.**

#### Design token-types
**- Global tokens**
	- Global tokens values, represented by context-agnostic names
	- #343434 -> Gray-100

**- Alias tokens** 
	- name related to specific context, making context easier to identify. 
	- Gray-100 -> bg-color

**- Component-specific tokens**
	- representation of value associated with a component
	- bg-color > primary-button-cta-color
