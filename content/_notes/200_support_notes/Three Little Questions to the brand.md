They serve as a starting point for developing a brand strategy and are essential for crafting a compelling narrative that resonates with the target audience.

1. **Who are you?** This question seeks to uncover the brand's identity. It's about defining the essence of the brand, its personality, values, and the overarching story that encapsulates what the brand stands for. Answering this helps the brand establish a clear and consistent identity that people can relate to and remember.
    
2. **What do you do?** Here, the focus is on the brand's offering. It's an exploration of the products or services the brand provides, focusing on the specific solutions it offers to its customers' problems or needs. It's not just about the features but the benefits and experiences that the products or services deliver.
    
3. **Why does it matter?** This question drives into the brand's value proposition and relevance. It's about the difference the brand makes in the lives of its customers and the reasons customers should care about the brand. This speaks to the brand's impact and contribution, highlighting the emotional and rational reasons why the brand is important and why it deserves the customer's attention and loyalty.
    

Together, these questions help a brand to clarify and communicate its core, convince customers of its worth, and convey what it stands for in a crowded market. They are the basis for building a strong brand strategy that guides marketing, communication, and product development efforts.
