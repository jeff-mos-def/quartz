Hindsight bias, or the *I know it all along* bias. Humans tend to reconstruct stories around past events to underestimate the surprise caused by those events. 

If the event happens, people exaggerate the probability that they knew it was going to happen. If the event doesn't occur, they recall that they thought it was unlikely.
