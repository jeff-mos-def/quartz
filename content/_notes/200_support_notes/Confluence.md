Confluence is a collaborative workspace software developed by Atlassian, designed to help teams organize and share information efficiently. It serves as a content management system that allows users to create, manage, and collaborate on content in a structured way.

Confluence is primarily used for creating and storing documentation, project plans, meeting notes, product requirements, and more. Its features include:

- **Page Creation and Editing**: Users can create pages and blogs that are easy to edit and format. These pages can include text, images, videos, and links to other resources.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can work on the same page simultaneously, providing real-time updates and collaboration.
- **Templates**: It offers a variety of templates for different use cases like meeting notes, project plans, and product requirements, which help in standardizing documentation across the organization.
- **Integration with Other Tools**: Confluence integrates seamlessly with other Atlassian products like JIRA and Trello, as well as various third-party applications, enhancing its functionality in project management and issue tracking.
- **Permission and Access Control**: Administrators can control who has access to view and edit content on Confluence, ensuring information security and relevance.

Confluence is often used by [[Software Development]] teams, but its versatile nature makes it suitable for any team that requires a central knowledge repository or a platform for collaborative documentation. It helps in keeping team members aligned and informed, promoting better communication and efficiency in project management and operational processes.
