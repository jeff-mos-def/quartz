Kanban is a lean method to manage and improve work across human systems. This approach aims to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity and improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks.

In Kanban, work items are visually displayed on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time. It typically involves a simple board with columns that represent the production stages, from start to finish. As work progresses, items are moved from one column to the next, visually signaling their advancement through the process.

The key principles of Kanban include:

1. **Visualization of the Workflow**: By making all tasks visible on a board, everyone involved can have a clear understanding of the progress and current work status.
    
2. **Limiting Work in Progress (WIP)**: This involves restricting the number of tasks in progress at any one time to avoid overloading the team and to help identify bottlenecks in the workflow.
    
3. **Flow Management**: By monitoring the flow of work, teams can make adjustments to improve efficiency and handle bottlenecks.
    
4. **Explicit Policies**: Clear guidelines on how to handle different types of tasks and situations.
    
5. **Feedback Loops**: Regular meetings and feedback sessions to discuss improvements and adaptations.
    
6. **Continuous Improvement**: The process is regularly reviewed and updated for efficiency and effectiveness.
    

Kanban is widely used in software development, but its principles are applicable in various fields, including manufacturing, service industries, and project management. It emphasizes continuous delivery without overburdening the team members, enabling more flexible planning options, faster output, clear focus, and transparency throughout the development cycle.
