The philosophy that all knowledge originates in experience and observations. Itâ€™s a cornerstone of the scientific method and underlies much of modern science and medicine. In the context of Scrum, empiricism refers to the idea that solving complex problems, or doing complex work, can only be done using an exploratory process rather than relying on predetermined plans.
