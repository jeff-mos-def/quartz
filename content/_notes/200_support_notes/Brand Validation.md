To validate the brand, the Brand gap suggests five criteria. They are distinctiveness, relevance, memorability, extendibility, and depth.
- **Brand Distinctiveness** - stand out
- **Brand Relevance** - appropriate to goal
- **Brand Memorability** - recall brand expression
- **Brand Extendibility** - cross culture, cross media
- **Brand Depth** - number of levels
