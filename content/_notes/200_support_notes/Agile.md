The Agile family of methodologies is a superset of iterative development approaches aimed at meeting ever-changing customer requirements. Agile development proceeds as a series of iterations.

Agile is a methodology and mindset used primarily in [[Software Development]], emphasizing flexibility, collaboration, customer satisfaction, and the ability to respond quickly to change. It is characterized by its iterative approach to [[Project Management]] and software development, allowing teams to deliver work in small, manageable [[Increment]]s. 

Key principles of Agile include:

1. **Iterative and Incremental Delivery**: Agile breaks down projects into small, manageable pieces (iterations), allowing teams to deliver work in stages. This approach facilitates regular feedback and continuous improvement.
    
2. **Collaboration and Communication**: Agile emphasizes close collaboration among cross-functional teams and with stakeholders. Regular communication is key to understanding requirements, addressing challenges, and aligning on goals.
    
3. **Customer Focus**: Agile prioritizes customer needs and satisfaction, often involving customers or users in the development process to ensure the product meets their needs and expectations.
    
4. **Flexibility and Responsiveness to Change**: Agile methodologies are designed to accommodate changes in requirements and priorities, even late in the development process. This adaptability is a core aspect of Agile.
    
5. **Continuous Improvement**: Agile teams regularly reflect on their processes and performance to identify opportunities for improvement. This focus on learning and adaptation is integral to the Agile philosophy.
    
6. **Sustainable Development**: Agile promotes a sustainable pace of development, ensuring teams can maintain quality and effectiveness over the long term.
    
7. **Empowering Teams**: Agile gives teams the autonomy to organize and manage their work, fostering accountability, creativity, and a sense of ownership.
    

Agile methodologies include frameworks like [[Scrum]], [[Kanban]], and [[Extreme Programming]] (XP), each with its specific practices and tools, but all adhering to the Agile Manifesto's core values and principles. Agile's adaptability makes it suitable not only for software development but also for other types of projects and industries seeking a flexible, collaborative, and customer-centric approach to work.
