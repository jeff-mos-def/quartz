In Psychology, Priming is a phenomenon whereby previous stimulus influences a response to a subsequent stimulus, without conscious guidance or intention.

Priming works most effectively when the two stimuli are in the same modality. For example, visual priming works best with visual cues and verbal priming works best with verbal cues.
