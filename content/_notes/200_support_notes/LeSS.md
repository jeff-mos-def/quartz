LeSS, which stands for Large-Scale Scrum, is a framework used for scaling agile processes, but it differs from SAFe in several ways. LeSS is essentially Scrum applied to large-scale software development and focuses on simplifying and de-scaling organizational complexity.

Key aspects of LeSS include:

  <u>Scrum Principles:</u> LeSS is strongly rooted in the core principles of Scrum. It doesn't introduce much additional process machinery. Instead, it applies the principles of Scrum in a scaled context.

  <u>Feature Teams:</u> In LeSS, development teams are cross-functional and cover the full spectrum of the software development lifecycle, from design to integration. These teams focus on delivering complete features.

  <u>Sprint and Product Backlog:</u> Similar to Scrum, LeSS operates in sprints, typically lasting 2-4 weeks, and maintains a single product backlog for the entire product, regardless of the number of teams.

  <u>Roles:</u> LeSS minimizes additional roles. It primarily scales up the existing Scrum roles of Product Owner, Scrum Master, and Development Team. For instance, there is one Product Owner for the entire product, not per team.

  <u>LeSS Huge:</u> For very large developments, LeSS provides a framework called LeSS Huge, which introduces additional scaling elements such as Requirement Areas, each with its own Area Product Owner.

  <u>LeSS Framework Rituals:</u> LeSS adopts and scales Scrum rituals like Sprint Planning, Review, and Retrospective. These meetings are coordinated among teams to ensure synchronization and alignment.

  <u>Continuous Improvement and Learning:</u> LeSS puts a strong emphasis on continuous improvement, learning, and adaptation. It encourages regular reflection and process improvement within and across teams.

  <u>Simplicity and Lean Thinking:</u> LeSS promotes the idea of removing waste and focusing on simplicity. The principle is to do less unnecessary work, hence the name "LeSS."

  <u>Organizational Design:</u> LeSS often requires changes in organizational design. It advocates for feature teams over component teams and suggests reducing the need for middle management.

LeSS is favored in environments where the simplicity of Scrum is desired but needs to be applied across multiple teams working on the same product. It's less prescriptive and more adaptable than frameworks like SAFe, making it more suitable for organizations looking to maintain a strong agile culture without introducing too much overhead or complexity.
