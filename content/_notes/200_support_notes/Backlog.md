A backlog is a prioritized list of tasks, features, requirements, or other deliverables that need to be addressed or completed. The backlog is a dynamic and evolving document that represents a comprehensive list of everything that could be done by the team but has not yet been completed. Key characteristics of a backlog include:

1. **Prioritization**: Items in the backlog are typically prioritized based on various factors such as business value, strategic importance, customer needs, or urgency. The highest priority items are usually addressed first.
    
2. **Dynamic Nature**: The backlog is not a static document; it changes over time. As new requirements emerge and circumstances change, items may be added, removed, or reprioritized in the backlog.
    
3. **Detail Gradation**: Items at the top of the backlog are usually more detailed and better understood than those lower down. As items move up the list, they are typically broken down into smaller, more manageable pieces and described more thoroughly.
    
4. **Different Types**: In Agile methodologies like Scrum, there are often two main types of backlogs - the Product Backlog and the Sprint Backlog. The Product Backlog contains all requirements for the product, while the Sprint Backlog includes items selected for implementation in a specific sprint.
    
5. **Guiding Tool**: The backlog serves as a guiding document for the team to understand what needs to be done, aiding in planning and decision-making processes.
    
6. **Visibility and Transparency**: The backlog is usually visible to all team members, stakeholders, and sometimes even customers, ensuring transparency about what is being worked on and what is yet to be done.
    

The backlog is a fundamental component in Agile project management, acting as a central repository for all pending work and a tool for planning and tracking progress.
