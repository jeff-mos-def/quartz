The 4C Workshop Framework is a framework used specifically for running [[Design Sprints]], a process for answering critical business questions through design, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 

The 4Cs in AJ&Smart's framework stand for Collect, Choose, Create, and Commit. Here's a brief overview of each of these stages:

1. **Collect**: In this initial phase, the team gathers and shares all relevant information about the [[Project]]. This includes understanding the problem space, collecting existing ideas, and bringing in any necessary background data or research. The aim is to create a shared knowledge base that the team can refer to throughout the sprint.
    
2. **Choose**: During this stage, the focus is on identifying the most promising ideas or solutions from the collection phase. The team collaborates to prioritize and decide on the specific direction or concept that they will prototype. This involves critical thinking and decision-making to ensure that the best idea is selected.
    
3. **Create**: This phase is about bringing the chosen idea to life through rapid prototyping. The goal is to create a tangible representation of the idea that can be tested with users. It's about building just enough to learn and get valuable feedback without investing in full-scale development.
    
4. **Commit**: The final phase is about validating the prototype through user testing. The team commits to learning from user interactions and feedback. Based on this feedback, they can make informed decisions about whether to pivot, iterate on the idea, or proceed with development.
    

AJ&Smart's 4C's Framework is specifically tailored to the design sprint methodology, which is an intensive, short, and focused process used to quickly develop and test ideas. This framework provides a structured approach to navigating the fast-paced and collaborative nature of design sprints.
