Iteration Goals are a high-level summary of the business and technical goals that the Agile Team agrees to accomplish in an Iteration. They are vital to coordinating an Agile Release Train (ART) as a self-organizing, self-managing team of teams. 

Iteration goals provide the following benefits: 
- Align team members to a common purpose 
- Align teams to common Program Increment (PI) Objectives and manage dependencies 
- Provide transparency and management information
