Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) refers to the continuous process of managing the life of an application through governance, development, and maintenance. It encompasses practices, processes, and tools that manage the lifecycle of an application from its conception through to its retirement. ALM is a comprehensive approach that integrates various aspects of software development, including requirements management, architecture, coding, testing, tracking, and release management.

Key components of ALM include:

<u>Requirements Management:</u> This involves gathering, analyzing, and documenting the requirements of the application. It's crucial for ensuring that the final product meets the needs of the users and stakeholders.

<u>Development:</u> This stage covers the actual coding or programming of the application. It involves tasks such as design, coding, unit testing, and integrating different components or services.

<u>Quality Assurance (QA) and Testing:</u> Quality assurance is integral to ALM, ensuring that the software meets certain standards of quality. Testing is conducted to identify and fix bugs, verify functionality, and ensure the application meets the initial requirements.

<u>Project Management:</u> This involves planning, scheduling, tracking progress, and managing changes to ensure that development proceeds in a controlled and efficient manner.

<u>Deployment:</u> ALM covers the process of deploying the application to production environments where it can be used by end-users.

<u>Maintenance and Support:</u> After deployment, the application requires ongoing maintenance and support to deal with any issues, provide updates, and ensure it continues to meet user needs over time.

<u>Collaboration and Communication:</u> Effective ALM requires collaboration among various stakeholders, including developers, testers, project managers, and end-users. Tools and practices for collaboration are an essential part of ALM.

<u>Integration:</u> ALM often involves integrating various development tools and platforms to ensure a seamless flow of information and processes across the lifecycle.

<u>Governance and Compliance:</u> Managing compliance with relevant standards and regulations is a critical aspect of ALM, ensuring that the software meets legal and corporate compliance requirements.

ALM tools and solutions provide a framework for software development and are crucial in helping organizations manage the complexity of modern application development. These tools typically offer a range of functionalities that support the different stages of the lifecycle and promote integration and efficiency across the process. The goal of ALM is to improve the quality of software, accelerate delivery times, and streamline the process of software development.
