JIRA, also known as an Application Lifecycle Management ([[ALM]]) tool, is a software product developed by Atlassian that provides issue tracking and project management capabilities. Primarily used in software development, JIRA helps teams plan, track, and manage agile [[Software Development]] projects. It allows for tracking bugs, managing [[Backlog]]s, and handling agile projects through methodologies like [[Scrum]] and [[Kanban]].

As an ALM tool, JIRA encompasses the entire lifecycle of software development, from initial concept and planning stages through development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. It provides a central platform for managing software development processes, ensuring that all aspects of the application's development are aligned and integrated.

JIRA's features include customizable workflows, detailed reporting, and integration with a variety of other development tools. This makes it a versatile and powerful tool for managing complex software projects and processes, aligning with the broader objective of Application Lifecycle Management in facilitating efficient project execution and product delivery.
