The PMBOK (Project Management Body of Knowledge) is essentially a comprehensive framework that provides a set of standard terminology and guidelines for project management. It is designed to standardize the project management processes and practices across various industries and organizations. The PMBOK is not a methodology in itself but a guide that can be tailored to fit a wide array of project types and management styles.

Organized into knowledge areas and process groups, the PMBOK covers ten core domains, ranging from integration to stakeholder management, which are crucial for the successful delivery of projects. These knowledge areas define the competencies that project managers must develop, while the process groups organize the project lifecycle into stages such as initiating, planning, executing, monitoring and controlling, and closing. The PMBOK’s process-based approach ensures that project managers have a detailed understanding of each phase of a project's lifecycle and the necessary tools to navigate them, aiming for efficient project completion within scope, time, and budget constraints​.
