The book offers insights on creativity and idea generation. The book presents a clear and logical breakdown of common ideas and dispels myths associated with creativity. Author argues that creativity can be cultivated and introduces a comprehensive 6-phase pyramid to guide readers through the creative process.

One of the book's strongest points is the introduction of the "RIGHT framework," which serves as the centrepiece. The third part of the book talks about the process of refining one's own ideas and how to find the creative potential within an organisation.

Unlike some other non-fiction works that merely stretch out blogposts into books, this book goes through 4-5 topics, along with RIGHT framework, make it it a concise read.
