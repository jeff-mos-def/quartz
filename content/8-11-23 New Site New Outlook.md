### It's time to get a little cleaner

For awhile now I've been hosting my personal *"portfolio"* on Google Sites. The time has come to switch over to something a little more functional and representative of my intentions.

I’m excited to announce that I'm transitioning my professional website from Google Sites to a self-hosted setup on Netlify. This move is a significant step for the site, which has become a dedicated resource for professionals seeking guidance on career progression in agile, project management, coaching, or just looking to hang out and see what's going on.

The reason for this change is twofold: to provide a more robust and reliable user experience and to take full advantage of the flexibility that Netlify offers. The new platform will enable me to implement the latest web technologies that are essential for delivering high-quality content efficiently and securely.

By moving to Netlify, I’m also looking forward to offering a faster, more responsive site. This is especially important as the content expands to cover more in-depth topics and interactive features that support career advancement. The new environment is designed to handle a growing library of resources while ensuring that you, the visitor, can access information seamlessly, whether you're on a desktop or a mobile device.

I want to use this platform to continue speaking about [[Agile]] and other [[Project Management]] topics, as well as whatever comes to mind.

This migration marks a new chapter for the site, one that underscores my commitment to sharing knowledge and providing mentorship in the fields of agile, project management, and coaching. Stay tuned for updates as the site evolves, and thank you for your continued support.

I hope to hear from all of you.

All the best.
